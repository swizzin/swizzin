# One place to keep track of the functions that are being sourced in at the beginning of the `box` and `setup.sh` scripts.
# Please ensure that any functions or variables you'd like to have available through sourcing in this file need to be exported.
# This means `export $variable` or `export -f function_name `.
# If you're planning to test single scripts outside of either `box` or `setup.sh` context, source this very file in your
# shell, and the functions and variables will be available until it is terminated.
