### Changed

- Many long-winded and re-used functions have been branched to separate function files for ease of future updates. Update the code in one place rather than 3. (eg. mono, rtorrent, deluge)
- Debian 10 did not ship with checkinstall, thus a new package mangaement application has been pulled in: `fpm`

- Update mono snapshot to 5.18. Less memory leaks! :tada:
- Nextcloud version support has been limited to v15 for operating systems which will not upgrade beyond PHP7.0, as nextcloud has dropped support for 7.0 in its latest versions.
- SickRage is now SickChill
- Update sabnzbd to stable branch (khnielsen)
- Update ruTorrent script for new plugin depends
- rTorrent builds other than feature-bind have been re-enabled for all supported operating systems due to instability in `feature-bind`
- Lounge script has been updated for v3 features
- Plexpy is now Tautulli (I still can't spell that)

- Longstanding typo in Jessie for adding the dotdeb php repo key
- Stuck jackett install :tada:
- Added checks to `box adduser` and `box deluser` to prevent clobbering and potential data loss issues.
- Removing flood will no longer remove ruTorrent (oops!)
- xmr-stak build script for new PoW algorithms
- systemd nofiles limit was too low
- Emby install location
- GPG key add for x2go on Debian

## [1.4.0]

### November 15, 2018

### Added

- Wireguard VPN package. Rejoice!
- VSFTPD and ZNC will now use your Let's Encrypt certificate. (d2dyno)

### Changed

- Simplified the rclone install script. (d2dyno)
- Plexpy is not Tautulli. (ooohhh)
- deluge-console will now be installed if choosing a "repo" install. (quarreldazzle)
- Ubuntu installer will now enable universe/multiverse repos
- xmlrpc now uses the advanced version to fix message flooding in the rtorrent gui (kennydeckers)
- Mono will use snapshot v5.8 to prevent issues arising from new versions (\#fuckmono)


### Fixed

- Fixed Ombi not starting
- Libtorrent sometimes failed to create a .deb file during compile (quarreldazzle)

### Removed

- clean_log function was useless

## [1.3.0]

### April 27, 2018

### Added

- Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver). Compatibility has not been thoroughly tested; however popular apps (rtorrent, nginx, deluge, mono-based, sickrage, etc) have been tested and should be working. Please report any issue you may have.
- Upgrades from 16.04 to 18.04 should in theory be possible. The biggest change at this time is the transfer to php7.2 from php7.0. The update script accounts for this, but it might not be perfect!

### Removed

- Support for EOL Ubuntu 17.04.

### Changed

- Mono will now utilize the 4.8.1 snapshot for all mono-based applications. This will hopefully prevent breakage due to bleeding edge mono updates and reduce frequency of updates. It became clear that there were some issues in general with Debian Jessie and these compatiblity issues should now be fixed as well.
- RPC mount (/{username}) will now be configured for Flood as well, even if ruTorrent is not installed (Compatibility for Sonarr/Radarr)
- Updated the xmr-stak script to account for the PoW changes from the recent hard fork.
- Added env_keep home for Ubuntu installs to negate the need to use `sudo -H` to reset your home folder to root every time.
- swizzin custom path reverted back to being set in .bashrc as .profile was causing issues for the majority
- btsync now runs as master user to prevent permission issues

### Fixed

- Only run ruTorrent plugin initialization on first install
- Ombi install/upgrade issues (upgrade to v3 should be soon)
- Update headphones PID path to prevent permission errors after reboot
- Emby repository issues under Ubuntu
- Removed some unneeded commands in rTorrent that might throw (ignorable) errors
- Panel update script should now respect your diskspace widget settings (home or root)
- Panel update script should now respect your custom.menu.php
- Small issue with the shellinabox systemd script
- Ensure ruTorrent plugins are properly initialized during rtorrent start
- Cleaned up a few straggling files that might've been left behind when deleting a user
- Fixed an issue where deluge configs for nginx weren't being generated for sub-users
- Fix an issue where php files in rtorrent/deluge download folders were being returned as a 404 -- this fix allows them to be served directly as downloads (php will not be executed in these folders as it is a security issue)

## [1.2.0]

### March 3rd 2018

### Added

- `rtx` or `box rtx` command for ruTorrent extras management like themes and plugins. The interface should feel similar to the installer/traditional box interface as it basically reuses the same code ;) Also added a few new plugins not currently included (fileshare, pausewebui, etc) that can be installed post-setup.

### Changed

- rTorrent will now use unix sockets rather than TCP sockets. While the TCP implementation was secured properly to prevent external access, there was still an issue of trust for local users (any user could access a TCP socket and execute arbitrary commands). This allows a finer grain of control for permissions and is ultimately the more secure/better way to implement the RPC layer.
- Some under the hood improvements for box add/remove user functions
- Added bold-red post install info to help people better understand that box will not function unless you `source /root/.profile`
- Cleaned up some old references to xmr-stak-cpu in the xmr-stak script
- Removed some unused permissions

### Fixed

- npm permissions for global installs
- Ensure all ruTorrent nginx confs are removed if ruTorrent is removed.
- systemd execstart for nzbget to be compatible with older versions of systemd (Ubuntu 16.04)
- Ensure .master.info is rewritten with current password info if master user password is changed with `box`
- Netdata appstatus in panel
- Let's Encrypt installer was overwritting the default config certificates even when told not to.
- Nextcloud compatibilty for Debian Jessie
- Ensure home folders are not readable for "Others"
- Ensure user's lounge accounts are also removed during `deluser`

## [1.1.1]

### January 21st, 2018

### Changed

- Nginx reverse proxies will now default to the $host header rather than $proxy_host
- Don't use apt in scripted scenarios, use apt-get

### Fixed

- Ubuntu 17.10 compatibilty for Emby Media Server, Plex Media Server and NextCloud
  - NOTE: Plex's apt repository is technically not compliant with the new version of Ubuntu and thus you **will** see warnings on Ubuntu 17.10 each time you `apt update`. This is not in my control. I suggest you comment out the repository in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list` and `box upgrade plex` to use the update script to avoid warnings.
- Better sed matching for potential changes in the fancyindex naming
- Updated depends in various packages to improve stand-alone functionality

## [1.1.1] 

###January 10th, 2018

### Fixed

- Full compatibility for php7.1 (Ubuntu 17.10)
  - Ubuntu 17.10+ now defaults to php7.1. The installer will now attempt to detect which php version you are running and compensate as needed.
  - There is now an update nginx script (run with `box update` that will future-proof your installs by installing the appropriate metapackages (php-fpm vs php7.0-fpm) and  update your nginx configs to use php7.1 (if needed), so that if/when you update Ubuntu 16.04 to the next LTS version in a few months, you'll be covered! After running dist-upgrade, simply run the `box update` or `box upgrade nginx` command to reconfigure your confs.

### Changed

- rTorrent installs will now default to the "feature-bind" branch (git development version) if you are using Debian 9 or Ubuntu 17.10+. If issues arise, I may re-enable the patch route; however at the moment no patches are needed to compile rTorrent on Stretch or Artful. Additionally, feature-bind has been enabled on older branches (Ubuntu 16/Debian 8) as well.
  - PLEASE NOTE: rTorrent has deprecated certain RPC calls in the new version. If you use filebot a post-processing script with rTorrent, rTorrent may fail to start because your configuration holds deprecated values. Please see [here](https://www.filebot.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4765) for info about updating your post-process command.

## [1.1.0]

### December 28th, 2017

### Added

- [xmr-stak](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak) xmr-stak-cpu has been deprecated. New dev fee minimum is 1.0. If you find this fee appaling, compile xmr-stak yourself and consider donating to the xmr-stak project.

- Jackett is no longer finicky about the trailing slash in its URI (/jackett)
- Certain conditional error logic might not have exited a script when it should have (e.g. Let's Encrypt)

## [1.0.0 Pre-Stable]

### October 9th, 2017

### Added

### September 29th, 2017

### Changed
- Disabled HSTS in nginx SSL params. [Why?](https://github.com/liaralabs/swizzin/commit/5f9af8d3dea9ebd06fa072c322f8fa7b54b431b2)

## [1.0.0-RC2]

### September 21st, 2017

### Added
- Flood is now available!
  - If you have nginx installed, you can access it from the web at /flood. Otherwise, flood port will be printed upon install. Please note, SSL is not currently configured for non-proxied configurations. If you need SSL without nginx, you will have to configure it yourself.
  - Flood has a complimentary upgrade script. `box upgrade flood`
  - Please note that there are currently some bugs when using both Flood's authentication and nginx basic authentication. You might need to complete nginx authentication a couple times. Flood authentication will be disabled once the option exists. Until then there is no fix.
